                What’s so great about a breakup?
                <br />
                <br />

                <strong>Everything.</strong>
                <br />
                <br />

                Letting go of the people, places, and patterns that no longer serve us means we aren’t stuck, stagnant, or stifled. So why doesn’t everyone do it? Put simply: It’s easier to stay put.
                <br />
                <br />

                Anyone can get stuck in the loop of dream → disappointment → despair →, with little to no progress in one or more areas of their life. If this sounds familiar, you’re not uniquely broken–you’re just on the brink of a breakup.
                <br />
                <br />

                As a compassionate breakup artist and time bender, I help highly motivated individuals dissolve limiting relationships–to jobs, people, and habits–using personalized, strategic action plans. Together, we’ll apply focused energy and uncommon clarity to rapidly achieve results that could otherwise take years. It’s collaborative time-bending at its best!
                <br />
                <br />

                If you’re wary of standard life coaching but know you need reinforcements, you’re in the right place. Exponential growth and transformation can occur when we align, chart a clear course, and implement strategies uniquely tailored to your dreams. But it’s about so much more than just coaching–it’s about radical accountability and cultivating the courage to shine forth.
                <br />
                <br />

                Breaking free means stepping into a fuller, more expansive life with entirely new levels of success, responsibility, and freedom. Not everyone is ready. But if you’re willing to trade familiarity for focused, fearless expansion, you’re not everyone:
                <br />
                <br />

                You’re a time-bending, miracle-creating, beacon of life-giving light.
                <br />
                <br />

                You’re breakup material.

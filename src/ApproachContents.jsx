                  You don’t just need a coach—you need someone who can look at your successes, struggles, and story and see two things: The common thread of authenticity that’s been buried, and the common thread of <strong>IN</strong>authenticity that’s got you stuck.

                  With over 12 years in corporate leadership and extensive experience helping high-performing individuals, I have both lived <strong>and</strong> witnessed the rapid success-to-burnout pipeline–and I can promise you: It’s NOT inevitable.

                  As a Breakup Artist, I help you change your relationship with people, places, and patterns that no longer serve you. But the real magic happens in the chemistry we create—because transformation requires more than strategy. It thrives on <em>trust</em> and <em>connection</em>. I have a gift for helping people feel at ease from the outset, which means we can dive deep quickly and get to the heart of what’s holding you back.
